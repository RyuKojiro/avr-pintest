avr-pintest
===========

A quick application to test an Atmel AVR microcontroller for pin shorts.

This was originally created to test Teensy/AVR based NOR/NAND flashing hardware for shorts after being soldered to the flash chip. However, this can be used for pin testing any project involving soldering AVRs which shouldn't (or should) have shorted pins.

Just build it, run it, and connect to the USB serial port created.
